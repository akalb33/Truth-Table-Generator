# Truth-Table-Generator

By Andrew Kalb

This program is a tool that I created to assist me in my digital design class. 

It takes a boolean algebra expression as an input, and produces a truth table as an output. 

HOW TO RUN THIS PROGRAM:
 - Either pen the solution for this program in Visual Studio Community 2019 and manually run the program (CTRL + F5) from there
 - OR, download the folder named "Download-This" and launch the executable.
